# deluge-cheez
`deluge-cheez` is a great ansible playbook. Believe me.
This sets up the deluge daemon and web client on an Ubuntu VM

# Setup

The server you are setting up needs to have python on it:
        apt-get install python

# Usage


# cifs-utils
The role included was not available on Ansible Galaxy so you would need to pull from the github link.
